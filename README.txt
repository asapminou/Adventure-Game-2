Adventure Game

Navigation finally works
The goal is to get to the final destination
Directions and the only valid inputs are up, down, left, right

I wanted to add items to collect throughout the map 
and you would need those items in order to complete the game
but I was not sure how to add it just yet. 
I'm also trying to figure out how to have the game be over after you've made it to the final destination.

Completegame Branch is A3
